Insertion Sort Algorithm.

Its a sorting algorithm that builds a final sorted array (sometimes called a list) one element at a time. While sorting is a simple concept, it is a basic principle used in complex computer programs such as file search, data compression, and path finding. Running time is an important thing to consider when selecting a sorting algorithm since efficiency is often thought of in terms of speed. Insertion sort has an average and worst-case running time of O(n^2)O(n 
2
 ), so in most cases, a faster algorithm is more desirable.
